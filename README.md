# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
A traveling salesman wishes to go to a certain number of destinations in
order to sell objects. He wants to travel to each destination exactly once and
return home taking the shortest total route.
Each voyage can be represented as a graph G = (V,E) where each destination,
including his home, is a vertex, and if there is a direct route that connects
two distinct destinations then there is an edge between those two vertices.
The traveling salesman problem is solved if there exists a shortest route that
visits each destination once and permits the salesman to return home
